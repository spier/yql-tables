DynECT REST API
------------------

https://dynectemail.tenderapp.com/help/kb/api

DynECT returns too much data for YQL to handle properly, because of the maximum response time limit of YQL. This may frequently result into this YQL warning:
	
	<warning>Results may be truncated because the run exceeded the allowed max response timeout of 30000ms.</warning>
