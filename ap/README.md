# YQL Datatables for the API of the Associated Press

The API of the Associated Press requires you to register for an API key. Register for a key at [http://developer.ap.org/](http://developer.ap.org/).
There are different Levels of Service, if you you just want to test out the API then I recommend applying for "Sandbox" level.
